    This reader is the abstract base class of all readers.

    In case you want to extend this library with a dataset of your own, you should
    create a subclass of `AbstractReader`. It defines the public interface that all
    data modules in this library use. Just inherit from this class implement the
    abstract functions, and you should be good to go.
