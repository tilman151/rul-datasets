    Truncate RUL data according to `percent_broken` and `included_runs`.

    RUL data has two dimensions in which it can be truncated: the number of runs and
    the length of the runs. Truncating the number of runs limits the inter-run
    variety of the data. Truncating the length of the run limits the amount of
    available data near failure.

    For more information about truncation, see the [reader][rul_datasets.reader]
    module page.

    Examples:
        Truncating via `percent_broken`
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from rul_datasets.reader.truncating import truncate_runs
        >>> features = [np.random.randn(i*100, 5) for i in range(1, 6)]
        >>> targets = [np.arange(i*100)[::-1] for i in range(1, 6)]
        >>> (features[0].shape, targets[0].shape)
        ((100, 5), (100,))
        >>> features, targets = truncate_runs(features, targets, percent_broken=0.8)
        >>> (features[0].shape, targets[0].shape)  # runs are shorter
        ((80, 5), (80,))
        >>> np.min(targets[0])  # runs contain no failures
